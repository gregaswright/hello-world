# hello-world
A place for ideas, resources and discussions. 
Hello everyone! My name is Greg. Before the pandemic, I was a chef who only dabbled in coding, but after losing my job because of the shutdown I was able to direct all of my attention towards coding and found my passion for it grew. Iâ€™m excited to take our skills to the next level with all of you over the next 15 weeks.
